                Around the age of 11 I discovered Game Maker.<br/>I began using it to create a variety of random game
                projects using Game Maker's drag and drop tools.
                The program did have a more powerful feature however, and that was GML. The Game Maker Language.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's this language that sparked my interest in programming. I still remember learning what variables are
                and how to use curly braces. It was a steep learning curve but it was so worth it.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the Game Maker Language I moved on to Visual Basic Windows Forms, then C#, then Python,.. and I
                just kept going, exploring more and more languages.

                Then came the desire to turn my hobby into something more. I wanted to be a software developer, not just a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started studying Software and Systems Engineering at the Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen in Bruges.
